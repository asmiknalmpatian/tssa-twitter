## Hello world

This tutorial on **topic modeling** and **sentiment analysis** intends to show you around the grounds in the wide realm of text analysis.

We will work on a corpus of Twitter data by German MPs.

The tutorial covers two approaches: roll up your sleeves for some handcrafted R code, or step up your game with BERT in Python.

Feel free to reach out to us anytime via GitHub: @asmiknalmpatian and @lisa-wm.

**Happy mining!**

### Whazzup

This is supposed to be a chunk of R code

```r

# Lo and behold this genius computation

foo <- function(x) {x + 1}

```
